 ------------------------------------

 About:
 ===============
   Ample SDK is a standard-based cross-browser JavaScript GUI Framework
   for building client-side Rich Internet Applications. It employs XML
   technologies (such as XUL, SVG or HTML5) for UI layout, CSS for UI style
   and JavaScript with DOM3 or jQuery-like APIs for application logic.
   It equalizes browsers and brings technologies support to those missing any.

 Running on source:
 ===============
   There are 2 options to run Ample SDK from source. First (slow) involves an HTTP web-server,
   the other (fast) requires the Apache web-server with mod_rewrite, PHP and .htaccess support.
   Note! It is not possible to run Ample SDK source version from the file system.

   1. Running with any HTTP web server
      In this scenario server returns source-only "loader" files which make additional
      requests for all other files referenced from it that make up certain library.

   2. Running with Apache HTTP web server with mod_rewrite, .htaccess support and PHP
      In this scenario server redirects the requests to resources/assemble.php script that
      concatenates source folders contents into single files on the fly. This is faster
      compared to the first option.

 Building with Ant:
 ===============
   The build script is located in "build.xml". Before running the script, verify and
   adjust path to your PHP executable and build destination in "build.properties"

 Pre-built distributives:
 ===============
   The latest stable build is available on Ample SDK website: http://www.amplesdk.com/download/
